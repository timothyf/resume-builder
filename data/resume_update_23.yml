      I am a passionate developer and leader with over 30 years of industry experience in roles that include
      both hands-on and leadership positions across organizations that range from small startups to large enterprises.

      Development is my passion and I have always sought to remain very close to technology. Nearly all of my
      roles have included hands-on development responsibilities. However, I also do enjoy opportunities to provide
      leadership, mentorship, and strategic vision to an organization.

      In addition to expertise in hands-on development, my skill-set includes business and management experience as
      well as team and project leadership and mentoring experience. I am also passionate about innovation, growing
      and leading teams and setting a technical vision for a company. I have a great deal of experience in the areas
      of full-stack web development, mobile development and scalable architecture. I am also well versed in Agile
      methodologies.

      I have been an evangelist for great software development in the Detroit area for many years.
      I am the founder and organizer of the Technology Mentorship Community for Michigan. I also
      enjoy technical writing. I am the author of two published books, the Java Phrasebook and the
