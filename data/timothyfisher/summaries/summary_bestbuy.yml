          I am a seasoned professional with over three decades of experience in
          the software development industry, blending hands-on software/web development
          expertise with leadership and management roles.
          <br/><br/>
          In my capacity as a leader and manager, I've excelled in overseeing both
          people and projects, fostering collaboration across various teams and
          stakeholders to drive success and business growth. My dedication to customer
          satisfaction led me to work closely with clients, ensuring their requirements
          were met and issues resolved to guarantee their happiness.
          <br/><br/>
          I am deeply committed to leadership, education, and mentorship. Beyond
          my extensive professional background, I am the founder and coordinator
          of the Technology Mentorship Community for Michigan. I also have a passion
          for writing, having authored two published technology books: the Java
          Phrasebook and the Ruby on Rails Bible.
          <br/><br/>
          Recently, I decided to explore new opportunities after serving as a Senior
          Manager with the New York Times web team, eager to embrace fresh challenges
          and roles.
