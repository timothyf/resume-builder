        Beyond my technical capabilities, I am deeply committed to educating, mentoring,
        and fostering communities of practice. For years, I have been an advocate
        for exceptional software development in the Detroit area, evidenced by my
        role as the founder of the Technology Mentorship Community for Michigan.
        My passion for technology extends to technical writing, as I take pride
        in authoring two published books: the Java Phrasebook and the
        Ruby on Rails Bible.

        results. I look forward to contributing my skills and expertise to a forward-looking
